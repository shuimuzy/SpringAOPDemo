# SpringAOPDemo

Aspect oriented programming (AOP) is one of the key components of Spring Framework. Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.

This is a demo to understand Spring AOP.
